Description: free Pico clone with some new features - tiny build
 GNU nano is a free replacement for Pico, the default Pine editor. Pine is
 copyrighted under a restrictive licence, that makes it unsuitable for
 Debian's main section. GNU nano is an effort to provide a Pico-like
 editor, but also includes some features that were missing in the original,
 such as 'search and replace', 'goto line' or internationalization support.
 .
 This package contains a minimal build of GNU nano, aimed for use in
 debian-installer. Thus, many features are disabled in this version.
